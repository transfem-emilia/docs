## Introduction

Downloading a save backup for a Flash game can help you keep access to your progress if your browser-stored save is lost.

## Download a Save

To download your save as a backup:

1. Right-click the game window (the area where the Flash game is running).
2. Click the download button next to the game title.

3. Your save file downloads.

If your browser asks where to save downloads, choose where you'd like to store the file.

## Upload a Save

To upload a save backup:

1. Launch the Flash game as usual.

If the game creates a save on launch, skip to step 3.

2. Create a save in an empty slot. You don’t need to play any levels — this just creates a save file.
3. Click the upload button next to the game title.

4. When your file browser opens, navigate to your save file and select **Open**.
5. When prompted to overwrite the existing save, click **OK** or **Yes**.
6. The game reloads and your backup save appears. You can continue playing as usual.
